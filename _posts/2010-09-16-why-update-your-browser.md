With the recent release of <a href="http://www.beautyoftheweb.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) Beta</a>, most &#8216;non-techie users&#8217; wonder about the importance of staying up-to-date with Browsers. Seriously! How important is it? Here is my take on this very first reaction.

<div style="width: 298px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Your Internet Browser; be it IE, Firefox, Opera or Chrome is your window to the Internet. Your browser remains the most used application while on the web. Further, today the web is not just about Websites but more about Web-Services. Services like <a href="http://omkarslab.co.cc/tag/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://omkarslab.co.cc/tag/twitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or even web-based mailboxes (<a href="http://omkarslab.co.cc/tag/gmail" target="_blank">Gmail</a>, Hotmail, etc.).

The service providers behind these web-services constantly tweak them for better speed and performance for end-users. At times this includes adapting to latest web-standards such as HTML5. For you to take advantage of such latest web-standards being up-to-date with the browsers is very much necessary.

There is more than just web-standards in a browser update. Every web browser takes some amount of time to render a web-page. So, practically it is not just your connection speed that matters during your Web Experience. Webpages include various types of content such as images, javascripts (more appropriately <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX" target="_blank">AJAX</a>) that let you view live content without a refresh, etc. It takes a considerable time for the browser to process each of these and render the page for you. Makers of these browsers constantly try to improve their speed and performance in various ways. Browser updates mostly include these improvements.

Apart from all these, security updates are also quite essential. Usually concerned with new web-standards.

Thus, updating your browser makes your Experience on the Web Richer, Faster, and more Secure. ðŸ˜‰
