Living in the world of Web 2.0, there are more Web services being developed on the Internet rather than Websites. Now what really makes these different? Well, in simple words a Web service is something that takes a request from you, process it and displays the results or stores them. Most common examples would be Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.

Beginners in the world of Web Development take a step back looking the complex architecture of such web services and the numerous installs of various components like Databases, Application Environments, Servers etc.

Microsoft&#8217;s WebMatrix is a Web developing environment that chooses to differ. Just one install, and you are ready with an ASP application environment + SQL server Compact database + ISS Developer Express 7.0. This is not where it stops. WebMatrix also supports development in PHP, and will guide you through the Installation of MySQL + PHP. Also a package of Open Source application installation like WordPress, Joomla, etc just a click away!

**Here is an Installation guide to WebMatrix**
