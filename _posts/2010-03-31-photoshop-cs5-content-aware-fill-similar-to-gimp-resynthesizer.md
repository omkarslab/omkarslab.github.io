  This is an update to my previous post on Adobe Photoshop&#8217;s Content-Aware Fill. <a href="http://www.omkarslab.co.cc/2010/03/26/upcoming-photoshop-cs5-content-aware-fill/">http://www.omkarslab.co.cc/2010/03/26/upcoming-photoshop-cs5-content-aware-fill/</a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  It was brought to my notice that the <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)</a>, which can be considered an Open Source equivalent to Photoshop has a plug-in called &#8220;<a href="http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/resynthesizer" target="_blank">Resynthesizer</a>&#8221; which seems to be a clone of &#8220;Content-Aware Fill&#8221; or otherwise. Here is a video demonstration of Resynthesizer using the same images Bryan O&#8217;Niel Hughes used for CAF.

  Amazingly similar, isn&#8217;t it? Well I could not find the exact date of the Plug-in release but found some mentions and descriptions on &#8220;Resynthesizer&#8221; in posts dated as early as January 2009. Sounds great. A one year old Open Source (free-to-use) program which is as good as $700+ worth commercial program.

  Readers apart from those who have already used or heard of GIMP will obviously want to try it out. Here are the guidelines to get GIMP and add the Resynthesizer plug-in to your installation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  1) Download &#8220;GIMP 2.6.8 Installer&#8221; (18MB approx) from here <a href="http://www.gimp.org/downloads/" target="_blank">http://www.gimp.org/downloads/</a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  2) Run the downloaded Setup. Keep the installation location as &#8220;C:\Program Files\GIMP-2.0&#8221; (default).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  3) Once you are done with installing GIMP, its time to add your plug-in. Download Resynthesizer  Compiled Windows version from here <a href="http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/resynthesizer" target="_blank">http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/resynthesizer</a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  4) Now paste the ZIP file in C drive. Right-click and select &#8220;Extract Here&#8221;. You are done!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  5) Now open GIMP, and open an Image you would like to play with. Select a region you would like to erase from the image. Go to Filters -> Map -> Resynthesize.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  6) A new window will open. Remove the  &#8220;Make horizontally tileable&#8221; and &#8220;Make vertically tileable&#8221; selection. Hit OK, and you are DONE.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Note: GIMP&#8217;s UI and handling is slightly difficult as compared to Adobe Photoshop. This makes it difficult for beginners to get the desired output at one go. Well, that is the only cost you got to pay here. Rest all is Free!
  </p>

    Cheers.
