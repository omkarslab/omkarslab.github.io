The 500 million user Social Network has always <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704513104575256701215465596.html" target="_blank">attracted criticism</a> from &#8220;Privacy Fanatics&#8221; about the lack of control over personal information posted on the Site. While most of them expressed concern over the complicated &#8220;Privacy Settings&#8221; panel provided and difficult to access settings, Facebook has been trying hard to <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=391922327130" target="_blank">make their controls simple</a>, but still not upto the mark.

I count myself amongst those privacy fanatics, so I tried to explore Facebook&#8217;s privacy settings and decipher it. While there are a few settings and controls that I din&#8217;t even think would exist, here is a quick walk through for you to set your account to the perfect tune. You begin your journey here&#8230;

<img class="alignnone" title="Being..." src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRn3RjafnGI/AAAAAAAAAvI/dXMAPbq8XLQ/s800/first.JPG" alt="" width="244" height="236" />

**1) Profile Information**

<div style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRoepJ9Rq2I/AAAAAAAAAvg/FEYUkGE5UdY/s800/the%20panel.JPG" target="_blank"><img class="    " title="Privacy Panel" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRoepJ9Rq2I/AAAAAAAAAvg/FEYUkGE5UdY/s800/the%20panel.JPG" alt="Main Panel" width="550" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Main Panel
  </p>
</div>

The main panel displays various predefined settings on the left section like Everyone, Friend of Friend, Friends Only and a Recommended setting. I choose to use a Custom setting which lets be specify access to bits of information. Once you click on the &#8220;Customize Settings&#8221; link you will see the following options. _**Note: I recommend never to use the &#8220;Friend of Friend&#8221; option as you have no control over the Friends your Friends add on Facebook. It is as good as &#8220;Everyone&#8221;.**_

<div style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRokfSWuhaI/AAAAAAAAAvo/pjLCUIyjEzY/s800/Privacy%20Settings.png" target="_blank"><img class="  " title="Custom Setting 1" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRokfSWuhaI/AAAAAAAAAvo/pjLCUIyjEzY/s800/Privacy%20Settings.png" alt="Custom Setting 1" width="550" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

</div>

Try to keep most of the information in this section closed to only your Friends. This is sensitive information and people you don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t need to know it either.

<div style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRoolWfcfjI/AAAAAAAAAv0/SxFn-eVCkBQ/s800/cust3.png" target="_blank"><img class=" " title="Contact Info" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRoolWfcfjI/AAAAAAAAAv0/SxFn-eVCkBQ/s800/cust3.png" alt="Contact Info" width="550" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Contact Info
  </p>
</div>

It is always good not to set your Email address view to &#8220;Everyone&#8221;. Prevents spammers from invading your profile.

<div style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRokffUWNKI/AAAAAAAAAvs/Di-DWHFFUD0/s800/cust2.png" target="_blank"><img class=" " title="Other Settings" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRokffUWNKI/AAAAAAAAAvs/Di-DWHFFUD0/s800/cust2.png" alt="Other Settings" width="550" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

</div>

Once again, commenting on your posts, and check wall posts by friends should be restricted to your friends to main your and your friends privacy.

**2) Applications and Websites**

This is the most Unexplored and Useful section in the Facebook Privacy Settings panel.

<div style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRn2qna_pOI/AAAAAAAAAuk/x9_ZXoPd6LU/s800/app1.png" target="_blank"><img class=" " title="Apps and Websites" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRn2qna_pOI/AAAAAAAAAuk/x9_ZXoPd6LU/s800/app1.png" alt="Apps and Websites" width="550" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Apps and Websites
  </p>
</div>

Here is how the panel looks. It allows you to remove unwanted applications, turn off applications. It is highly recommended that you install Apps from verified sources. Spammy or Scammy apps usually sound like &#8220;Whats color is your Name?&#8221; or &#8220;How sexy are you?&#8221;. Applications request access to your user information. Also check if the requested permissions are required for the app to function. I use application either created by me or internet services like Youtube, Foursquare and twitter.

<div style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRn2qpEqxGI/AAAAAAAAAuo/twIxJX4ycpY/s800/app2.png" target="_blank"><img class=" " title="App Setting Panel" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRn2qpEqxGI/AAAAAAAAAuo/twIxJX4ycpY/s800/app2.png" alt="App Setting Panel" width="550" /></a>

The Information accessible to Applications your Friends use, is something you must set first. Most of my friends have a habit to install spammy application, that by default have access to all the information my friends can see about me. Once you click on &#8220;Edit settings&#8221; make the dailogue box look like this.

<div style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRn2qzi9wII/AAAAAAAAAus/kAn56vpyYyE/s800/app3.png" target="_blank"><img class="   " style="border: 2px solid red;" title="Friends Apps" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRn2qzi9wII/AAAAAAAAAus/kAn56vpyYyE/s800/app3.png" alt="Friends Apps" width="550" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

The Instant Personalization setting lets you turn ON or OFF partner site services. Recommend it to OFF if you dont want other sites tracking your usage connected to you Facebook account.

Public Search lets you control information disclosed to search-engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo!

</div>

**3) Other Facebook Actions**

 ****If you are too popular amongst your group you can control, who adds you as a friend or sends you a message through &#8220;Connecting on Facebook&#8221; link from the Main Panel.

<div style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRn3Q_qEBTI/AAAAAAAAAu4/mlTt5LksEsk/s800/connect1.png" target="_blank"><img class=" " title="Actions" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRn3Q_qEBTI/AAAAAAAAAu4/mlTt5LksEsk/s800/connect1.png" alt="Actions" width="550" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

</div>

**4) Blocking Apps, Users, etc.** As the name suggests, this good to stop someone or some app from constantly bug you during your social experience. Once again found on the Main Panel.

<div style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRn3RObzRnI/AAAAAAAAAvA/4RiPWmzkhcQ/s800/connect2.png" target="_blank"><img class=" " title="Blocking" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Tf3uLIahhCQ/TRn3RObzRnI/AAAAAAAAAvA/4RiPWmzkhcQ/s800/connect2.png" alt="Blocking" width="550" /></a>

Using the Recommendations mentioned above will not affect your social experience. Instead, it will provide you a carefree environment. Still, over the Internet safety of content is completely based on trust and security of the ISP. Enjoy ðŸ˜€
