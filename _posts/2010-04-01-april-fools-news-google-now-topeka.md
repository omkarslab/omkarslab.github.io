  Google has done it again! Following the yearly tradition of playing an April Fools prank on the world, Google has just updated its blog announcing change in its Company name. &#8220;Google .Inc will now be called Topeka .Inc&#8221; says Eric Schmidt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Topeka .Inc (earlier Google .Inc) in the post.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  So why &#8220;Topeka&#8221; out of no where? Recently the Mayor of Topeka, Kansas declared that his city was changing its name to Google. Changing its own name to Topeka in turn happens to be Google&#8217;s way to return the honor.  Here are few issues the post discussed for the transition to the new name.
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Correspondence to both our corporate headquarters and offices around the world should now be addressed to Topeka Inc., but otherwise can be addressed normally.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Google employees once known as “Googlers” should now be referred to as either “Topekers” or “Topekans,” depending on the result of a board meeting that’s ongoing at this hour. Whatever the outcome, the conclusion is clear: we aren’t in Google anymore.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Our new product names will take some getting used to. For instance, we’ll have to assure users of <a href="http://news.google.com/news?rls=ig&hl=en&sa=N&tab=ln&q=">Topeka News</a> and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?rls=ig&hl=en&tab=wl" target="_blank">Topeka Maps</a> that these services will continue to offer news and local information from across the globe. <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/" target="_blank">Topeka Talk</a>, similarly, is an instant messaging product, not, say, a folksy midwestern morning show. And <a href="http://www.google.com/virgle/" target="_blank">Project Virgle</a>, our co-venture with Richard Branson and Virgin to launch the first permanent human colony on Mars, will henceforth be known as Project Vireka.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  We don’t really know what to tell <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/10/we-get-letters-3.html">Oliver Google Kai</a>’s parents, except that, if you ask us, Oliver Topeka Kai would be a charming name for their little boy.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  As our lawyers remind us, branded product names can achieve such popularity as to risk losing their trademark status (see cellophane, zippers, trampolines, et al). So we hope all of you will do your best to remember our new name’s proper usage:
