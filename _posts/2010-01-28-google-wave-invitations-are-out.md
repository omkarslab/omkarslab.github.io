Today Google sent out about 100000 invitations to users across the globe to preview Google wave. These invitations have been specifically sent to people who have been active in the Developer Preview of Google Wave which started back in June, some users who were first to sign-up for an invitation and some selected customers of Google Apps.

Google Wave is expected to release in the first week of October. But what exactly makes this product from Google so special?

Google Wave is an advanced communication and collaboration tool that was first announced by Google in its Google I/O Conference. A collection of sophisticated tools and features make Google Wave capable to work as an Email service, Wiki, Social Networking service, and Instant Messenger all at once.

**How does it work?**

 ****Google Wave is completely browser based service and needs no additional software requirement on the client computer. The service is written in Java using OpenJDK. Even though Wave is a browser based service it works like an Instant messaging application on your computer.

1) First you create a Wave ( something similar to a chatroom).

2) You add users you would like to participate in the wave.

3) You interact with other users in rich-text environment, sharing videos, pictures, messages, maps and much more.

4) You can edit messages sent by other users to enable you to work on a document collaboratively, eventually making the Wave work like a Wiki.

5) You can use a Timeline tool to even track the changes made to the Wave from time the Wave was created.

**Applications**

 ****Google Wave can be efficiently used for collaboratively creating a research document, and track the progress with Timeline tool. Google has even made the Google Wave API available for developers to create their own Google Wave applications which will help users in multiple ways to interact on a wave.

Some applications displayed at the I/O Conference held by Google included&#8230;

1) &#8220;Live Poll&#8221; lets Wave members vote on a particular topic, and check the changing stats live.

2) Twitter application lets users tweet on their Twitter account using Wave.

3) Google Maps application lets users share a Map and work on it collaboratively marking places and maybe planning a trip.

4) &#8220;Bloggy&#8221; the Blog application which shows the changes in a particular Wave on an external Blog.

With Google Wave, Google intends to change the way people used the Internet. Google also intends to release some the codes of Wave as Open Source to allow developers to develop some of its extensions, and what more? Google even plans to allow third-party services to build their own Wave services as it wants the Wave protocol to replace the Email protocol.

The main advantage of this Wave protocol will be that, the messages being sent in a Wave are saved on the service providers server rather than being sent to users. This enables users immediate access to updated content. Incase of users from multiple Wave services participating in a wave, the wave is federated amongst the providers of the users.</p>
