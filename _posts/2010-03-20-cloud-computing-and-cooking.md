<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Cloud Computing has been a buzz word over the Internet for quite sometime now. More and more web-services worldwide are now either adopting to some cloud platform, or bringing in their own cloud service. Yes, the cloud is getting bigger and bigger.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Majority of discussions on Cloud Computing classify the services as one of the primary trends. But this methodology seems inefficient considering the variations evolved from the primary trends. Here&#8217;s an explanation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Primarily there are three types of cloud computing trends&#8230;<br /> <strong>1) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong> A cloud service that provides total or majority of the infrastructure necessary to host a Web application. This mostly includes scalable hardware and bandwidth.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>2) Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> This would be a software application hosted on a remote server, with a multi-tenant architecture. The UI is mostly accessible on the browser.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>3) Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> A cloud service that has its own independent platform on which applications are designed based on the SDK.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong> </strong>Considering an existent Cloud Service such as Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Azure, classifying it as a single trend is actually not feasible. As Azure consist of sufficient features to enroll itself as an IaaS with its flexible storage, bandwidth and processing of applications stored on Microsoft&#8217;s very own datacenters and also considering the Azure platform and its SDK, we can classify it as a PaaS.

    <strong><em>&#8220;Looking at the current scenario it is obvious that the upcoming Cloud Services will be more of a mix of all trends. We can eventually conclude that building a cloud service will be more like cooking. Adding flavours of various trends into one single service&#8230;&#8221;</em></strong>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Taking a brief view at the demands of Web-applications, there is no constant. Each and every web-application has a unique requirement. Infact most web-developers subscribe to multiple cloud services to host their application based on the features. A well cooked cloud cloud service would be a relief to such developers who eat in several plates.
