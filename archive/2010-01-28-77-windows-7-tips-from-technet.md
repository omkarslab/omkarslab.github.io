I frequently go through the Microsoft Technology Center (MTC), and found out that I missed to blog a great post! We all have been desperately waiting for Windows 7 in India. Here are 77 tips of using Windows 7 that will surely enhance your usage experience.

Here are some selected tips that I really liked.

**1) Record Problems:** The Problem Steps Recorder (PSR) is a great new feature that helps in troubleshooting a system. At times, Remote Assistance may not be possible. However, if a person types psr in their Instant Search, it will launch the recorder. Now they can perform the actions needed to recreate the problem and each click will record the screen and the step. They can even add comments. Once complete, the PSR compiles the whole thing into an MHTML file and zips it up so that it can be e-mailed for analysis to the network admin (or family problem solver, depending on how it&#8217;s being used).

**2) Use Windows XP Mode:** Yes, it&#8217;s only an embedded Virtual PC with a full copy of WinXP—but it&#8217;s an embedded Virtual PC with a full copy of Windows XP! This is the first profoundly intelligent use of desktop virtualization we&#8217;ve seen—and a great way to move to Windows 7 without giving up full Windows XP compatibility.

**3) Burn Discs with a Click:** Or two; double-click an ISO file to burn it to your CD or DVD writer.

**4) RoboCopyCopyCopy:** The always-useful Robocopy.exe can now run multi-threaded; run Robocopy /? to review its new parameters (like /MT for multithreading) and make your copies go faster.

**5) Multiple Monitors:** Windows 7 makes working with multiple monitors intuitive and flexible. There are a variety of shortcuts and mouse motions that flick windows from monitor to monitor. To make the most of this, you need lots and lots of screen real estate. Try one of the new QWXGA monitors from Samsung (tinyurl.com/qwxgasamsung) or Dell (tinyurl.com/qwxgadell). These 23-inch monitors have a 2048&#215;1152 resolution, making it possible to put two full-sized pages on the same monitor. Pair them together and you&#8217;ll get enough space to have all your admin tools open along with Office, Visio, your intranet sites and a little note to your mom in Live Mail. Move your taskbar to the left or right side of the window instead of along the bottom to free up even more real estate.

**6) Create Virtual Worlds:** Virtualization capability has been added to the Disk Management tools. If you open Computer Management, go to the Disk Manager tool and then click the Action button at top, you will see the options Create VHD and/or Attach VHD. This allows you to create and mount a virtual hard drive directly from within the GUI. Note: With Windows 7 you even have the ability to boot a Windows 7 VHD

**7) Try out Improved WordPad:** You probably haven&#8217;t given much thought to WordPad lately, but the version shipping with Windows 7 has undergone a major renovation. Think of it as a lite version of Microsoft Word. WordPad sports a spiffy ribbon interface, making it a snap to create well-formatted documents. Plus, you are no longer relegated to saving them as .RTF files. WordPad now supports the Office Open XML document (.DOCX) format. This makes it even easier to open .DOCX files created in Word in WordPad.

**8) Improve Security:** In Vista it was difficult to manage system protection via restore points. The System Protection tab in Windows 7 is a vast improvement. In one spot you can configure how much space to devote to restore points, delete and create restore points or even turn off system protection altogether. This is very useful on older systems where disk space may be at a premium.
