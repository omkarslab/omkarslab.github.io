<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
    I'm an Electronics Engineer by education, yet Computer Science has been my primary interest since graduation. I've been building web and native device applications since 2007. I've attempted to bootstrap a startup building data analytics gateways and failed after a 3 year sprint. I've been spending much of my time wrapping my head around -how- why cryptography works, and how distributed ledger technologies can help enterprises build unconvential trust relationships.
